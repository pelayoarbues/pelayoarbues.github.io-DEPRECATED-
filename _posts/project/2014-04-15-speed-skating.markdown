#### Economic Impact of the Speed Skating World Cup 2008.
Gijón hosted the Speed Skating World Cup in 2008. The city council wanted to have some figures about profitability of hosting sport events.

####My role
I worked collecting data on the public investments made in the city and also surveying more than 150 attendants and participants about their expenditure in the city. I also contributed by reviewing the Input Output method and estimating the direct and indirect impacts of the event.
