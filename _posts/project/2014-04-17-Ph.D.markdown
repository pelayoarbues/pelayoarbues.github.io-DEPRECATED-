####Essays on Transport Economics.
My doctoral thesis Essays on Transport Economics collects three empirical research papers applying statistical and econometric techniques to different transport-related topics. In the first essay a spatial econometrics model is applied to the study of the economic contribution of transport infrastructure to regional productivity. The second essay is devoted to analyze road freight transportation demand applying a gravity equation in a panel data framework. The last essay aims to study the determinants of modal choice in long distance trips in Spain through the estimation of a multilevel multinomial model.
