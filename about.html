            <h4>More About me.</h4>
            <p>After finishing my Ph.D. in Economics at the end of 2013 I started working as a data analyst in the eKnow IT project. In this project I was responsible for analysing those best practices in logistics that make Transport Systems more sustainable. </p>
            <p>During my research experience I have realized that I have a passion about data. In this regard, I have devoted myself to improve my programming skills and to gain more knowledge in Machine Learning algorythms by taking specialized courses.</p>
            <p>Besides data science, economics and coding I love photography. You can check some of my latest pictures on <a href="http://pelayoarbues.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. </p>
